## About this Repo <a name="about"></a>
This repo is the official list of SP-API sample code. It is subdivided into sections for each use case (see ["Use Cases"](#use-cases)), which in turn include the proposed solution in different programming languages.
These examples each provide a demonstration of a well-architected, end-to-end implementation of a business use case that spans across one or more API sections. 

We welcome contributions to this repo in the form of fixes or improvements to existing content. For more information on contributing, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

This is considered an intermediate learning resource, and should typically be referenced after reading the [SP-API Documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api). Please see [Learning Resources](#learning) for additional resources.
